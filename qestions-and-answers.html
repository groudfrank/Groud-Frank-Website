                                a developer or a fireman or a farmer or a priest. Don't get me wrong,
                                there is wrong with
                                passionately choosing a career. Our personalities and temparaments
                                generally point us to certain fields and our jobs can change people's
                                lives for the better but the kind of change we affect 
                                comes from who we are and not necessarily what we do.

                            <h1>What do you want your legacy to be?</h1>
                            <p>
                            I'm honestly not very concerned with leaving a legacy. The universe is 
                            approximately 13.7 billion years old and the earth is appromixmately 4.5 billion.
                            Humans have been here for approximately 200,000 years and I am 28 years old.
                            Given the scale of the universe(size and age) it's kinda pointless trying to
                            leave a legacy behind.  
                            I think we like holding on to our mortality so much that we 
                            subconciously try to be immortal by leaving things behind. We are afraid 
                            people will forget us so we try to leave a mark. The problem there is that
                            we are attempting to leave a mark on the earth but that's only going to matter
                            for as long as the earth and people are around and both those things are finite -
                            as any scientist or priest will tell you. They may disagree about how it will come
                            to an end but they agree on the end result. 
                            I want my legacy to be obedience to God. If I aim for that I may be pleasing 
                            in the eyes of God and may, in the process, leave a legacy behind
                            but if I aim for leaving a legacy on earth I may achieve neither of those things.

                        <p> 
                            I started learning Web Development in 2015. This is actually,
                            my first website.

                        That's a tough one. What I love most is the high I get from 
                        resolving an error or bug after hours(sometimes days) of
                        frustration and failure. I learn far more about coding this

                            Ooooo... that's a close race between Python and JavaScript
                            but I think JavaScript would come out on top. JavaScript does 
                            have its quirks for sure: <br> <br>
                            '' == '0' //false <br>
                            0 == '' //true <br>
                            0 == '0' //true <br>
                            <i>Taken from JavaScript: The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford</i> <br><br>
                            Despite the fact that 0 can be equal to two things that don't 
                            equal each other I think JavaScript is a beautiful language
                            kinda like a Pug is so repulsive it's actually cute.
                            Python would have been my favorite if it did not have that 
                            awful whitespace code block system.

                        <h1>What's your least favorite language?</h1>
                        <p>
                        That would probably be PHP when I will eventually and reluctantly
                        attempt to learn it in the future. I've never tried to learn to learn
                        it but everyone seems to complain about it so I want to be ahead of 
                        the curve. <br>

                                   I hate gyms so I mostly run. I run 10 Kilometers a day, 5 days a

                                   being sand runs. I try to get some modest swimming and biking in.
                                   Want to start biking to work but Trinidad and Tobago does cater for 
                                   bikers all that much.

                                Thaaaaaat leaves a lot to be desired. I definitely don't pigout, I try
                                to have a balanced diet and I've cut back on my added sugar intake but 
                                there is still lots of room for improvement. I have a weakness for salty
