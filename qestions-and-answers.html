                            Would you believe me if I told you I don't know? Well, it doesn't matter
                            because I don't. The genuinely wonderful people I was begotten of
                            don't seem to know either. I know that might sound bad but do you know who else 
                            doesn't know the meaning of my name? Google. Trust me, I've tried. Google use to 
                            respond with:
                            <br>
                            <span class="google-red">Did you mean:</span> <span class="google-blue">Ground</span>
                            <br>
                            If Google doesn't know then I think you guys can cut my parents some slack. 
                            Besides I appreciate the uniqueness of it. There are lots of Toms, Dicks
                            and Harrys out there  
                            but I'm willing to bet you've never met a Groud before. I'm a rare breed.

                        question myself enough when negative thoughts pop up.
                        I tend to assume it's true and run with it. I'm working 
                        on that.

                            I don't think my calling is anything career related.

                            a web developer, fireman, baker or even a candlestick maker.
                            Don't misunderstand me, there is nothing wrong with
                            passionately choosing a career. Our personalities and temperaments
                            generally point us to certain fields and our jobs can change people's
                            lives for the better but the kind of change we affect
                            comes from who we are and not necessarily what we do.

                        <h1>What do you want your legacy to be?</h1>
                        <p>
                        I'm honestly not very concerned with leaving a legacy. The universe is 
                        approximately 13.7 billion years old and the earth is appromixmately 4.5 billion.
                        Humans have been here for approximately 200,000 years and I am 28 years old.
                        Given the scale of the universe(size and age) it's kinda pointless trying to
                        leave a legacy behind. 
                        <br><br>
                        I want my legacy to be obedience to God. If I aim for that I may be pleasing 
                        in the eyes of God and may, in the process, leave a legacy behind
                        but if I aim for leaving a legacy on earth I may end up not achieving
                        either of those things.
                        <br><br>
                        I see this life as a transition, as preparation. This life is the airport terminal, not 
                        the final destination. For me it doesn't make sense to take my plans here too seriously 
                        because none of us are promised tomorrow and we are all on borrowed time.<br>
                        I'm not saying that we shouldn't plan or put our best foot forward in this life.
                        We should! We must! I'm just say it's pointless living like the terminal
                        is home.
                        <br><br>
                        
                        <!-- <b>TL:DR</b> My concern ought to be living for God, not crafting a legacy. -->

                        <!-- I think we like holding on to our mortality so much that we 
                        subconciously try to be immortal by leaving things behind. We are afraid 
                        people will forget us so we try to "leave a mark". The problem there is that
                        we are attempting to leave a mark on the earth but that's only going to matter
                        for as long as the earth and people are around and both those things are finite.
                        <br><br>
                        I want my legacy to be obedience to God. If I aim for that I may be pleasing 
                        in the eyes of God and may, in the process, leave a legacy behind
                        but if I aim for leaving a legacy on earth, which is effectively attempting to please
                        man - even if that man is myself, I may end up not achieving either of those things.
                        <br><br>

                        You may not agree with me but we ought to be able to at least agree that we 
                        will all one day die, taking with us none of the earthly assests and glory we have aquired in this 
                        life. Not even our bodies we will be able to take with us.

                        terminal because there is a final destination I must get to.

                                If we're too busy for prayer/meditation/spiritual growth,
                                exercise, cooking a meal, reading a good book, calling relatives or spending
                                time with our kids then we are too busy. There are more than enough hours 
                                during the day. If we don't have enough then it's either we try to do too much 
                                or we mismanage the time we have.

                               That's actually an on going battle. It's a battle against myself. 
                               A battle against 'the self' so to speak.
                               Who knew seeking to console before being consoled, seeking to understand before 
                               being understood and seeking to love before being loved would be so hard?
                               I am selfish and putting others before myself is something I struggle with.
                               Having a 'self' means that there is always the risk of it wanting to be first.
                               It's not easy waging war against 'the self' but it must be done if I am to truly love.
                               It is a war I will be waging for the rest of my life I suspect.

                            Be vulnerable!
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I strongly believe that being vulnerable is a major sign that someone is truly living
                            life fully. We spend crazy amounts of money on plane
                            tickets thinking the only way we can experience life and find ourselves is by
                            traveling - attempting to purchase enlightenment, happiness and a sense of fulfillment
                            through adventure. And yet we leave on a plane one way and come back the same
                            people with the same bad habits, mental and otherwise. We live like clams but pretend
                            to be eagles. Being vulnerable, opening up to people and eventually to rejection,
                            hurt and disappointment taught me my most valuable lessons and has been the catalyst for
                            meaningful change in my life. Trials of hurt or any other kind for that matter
                            can be transforming, even liberating, if we allow them to be. When we wall ourselves
                            away we will never get hurt but we too will never grow and never be truly
                            free - never truly adventurous.

                        <p> 
                            I started learning Web Development in 2015. Started talking it more seriously
                            in 2016. This is actually, my first website. Build from scratch!

                        <p>
                        That's a tough one. What I love most is the high I get from 
                        resolving an error or bug after hours(sometimes days) of
                        frustration and failure. I learn far more about coding this 
                        way than reading coding books.

                            Ooooo... that's a close race between Python and JavaScript
                            but I think JavaScript would come out on top. JavaScript does 
                            have its quirks for sure: <br> <br>
                            '' == '0' //false <br>
                            0 == '' //true <br>
                            0 == '0' //true <br>
                            <i>Taken from JavaScript: The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford</i> <br><br>
                            Despite the fact that 0 can be equal to two things that don't 
                            equal each other I think JavaScript is a beautiful language
                            kinda like a Pug is so repulsive it's actually cute.
                            Python would have been my favorite if it did not have that 
                            awful whitespace code block system.

                            The process of ensuring a consistent design ethos across the insane 
                            amount of media and device variables. You have to make sure your websites 
                            looks good on Chrome, FireFox, Safari, IE, etc - make sure they look good in 
                            Linux, MacOS, Windows, etc - make sure they are optmized for mobile devices 
                            - and make sure you account for different display sizes, resolutions and aspect ratios.
                            What might look good on FireFox for Windows might look awful on Safari for MacOS.
                            Different browsers and rendering engines implement web standards different and it 
                            can be frustrating trying to please all these different variables while retaining 
                            fidelity to your original design ideas.
                            It's a lot of work and is very tedious.
